## ‚ú® About the project

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

This challenge was also done in the DevQuest course, where we started with the Advanced CSS module - Flexbox and concluded with the Advanced JavaScript module, using an API.
